Anyone aware of technology that students use to cheat on exams by connecting with outside experts in real time?,bgvk3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/bgvk3z/anyone_aware_of_technology_that_students_use_to/,7,1556117577.0,1,"I'll get to the point up front.

**Are there any common ways (e.g., phone apps) that connect students with ""experts"" in different subjects areas so that they can cheat in real-time during an exam?**

I teach at a small college in the US and I (and some of my co-workers) have had episodes of students who were clearly^† cheating during the exams, but it was not the type of cheating that I had grown up with. When I was a kid, you just stuffed a crib sheet up your sleeve and hoped for the best. It's pretty clear that the new strain of cheaters are using phones (or small cameras) to broadcast the exam contents OUT and then using their phones to receive answers back IN.

The circumstantial reasons in support of the explanation described above are:

* I make up _new_ exams each semester. The students could not have had advanced access to the exam. This is also true for my co-workers.

* The most recent episode involved a student in one of my classes (chem) as well as a biology class. The Biology instructor thinks the student had a camera in her bra. Student used the bra-camera (I can't believe I'm even typing this) to broadcast the exam to an ""expert"" and then the student had her cell phone hidden between baggy pants. Student would perform this weird ritual of not looking at the exam for several minutes at a time--then she would fidget with her legs, and then there would be a burst of answering, which was followed by another long cycle of not looking at the exam and scanning the room.

* This student essentially failed all smaller quizzes / assignments. i.e., This is not a case of me (or my colleagues) underestimating the student's talent. I've had a few episodes similar to this in recent years (i.e., students who clearly have no idea what they are doing, and yet they get the highest scores on the exam), so I feel like this is a technological trend that I need to get in front of.

What is most fascinating to me is **who is feeding the students the answers**?

This feels like a situation where there is a phone app that connects you to someone who actually knows the material in a 3rd world country (probably for a fee). On the one hand, this explanation makes the most sense to me because I have detected this type of cheating with a number of _different_ students over the past three years (i.e., This is not just an isolated incident of someone who had a really smart boyfriend/girlfriend who was willing to help out-- these are incidents that suggest there are _groups_ of domain experts selling a cheating service).
On the other hand, if there is such a marketplace for remote cheating, why haven't I heard of it 
 in the news or from other students (other than the fact that I'm an old geezer)?


†I caught three students in the act of doing this about 3 years ago, but I never bothered to see HOW they were doing it because I thought it was a technological aberration. But the fact that there are more students who appear to be doing the same type of cheating is making me think more seriously about the issue.",2019-04-24 09:52:57

5 Ways to Keep You On Top Of Your Coursework,bguinr,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/bguinr/5_ways_to_keep_you_on_top_of_your_coursework/,1,1556111958.0,0," 

**From the beginning till the end of your coursework, you come across many challenges, difficulties, and hurdles. For every student, panning out a coursework is like conquering a mountain!**

**To make your coursework process much easier for you, we have come up with 5 tips that can help you to handle your coursework competently.**  

## 1.Do a lot of prior research

**Coursework is all about an extensive research. Whenever you get free from your classes or other tasks, research about your topic. The more you read and gain knowledge about your topic, the better your coursework will turn out to be. Gather more data and use different resources like books, newspapers, journals, internet, or TV.**  

## 2.Choose topic wisely and the one that interests you

**We know how complicated a research becomes when the topic is not of your interest. So we advise you to choose only the topic in which you are interested in. If you are passionate about the topic, your coursework becomes more enjoyable. Also, ensure that you have chosen your topic wisely. By wisely we mean your topic must be relevant and researchable. This way, you can easily gather enough data on it to write it down. Besides, you will have a clear direction of how you are going to manage your coursework.**

## 3.Plan and organize

**Keep a notebook or planner with you to note down key points about your coursework. Plan ahead what you are going to include, how you are going to write, and where you get information from. Divide your task into parts and plan how long it’s going to take. To stay top of your deadlines, organize everything in advance. Also, know all the guidelines and your instructor’s requirements. This will prevent you to miss anything or deviate from necessary instructions.**  

## 4.Structure your writing and Do final check

**After research and planning, you begin writing up your coursework. This is the most essential part where you need excellent essay-writing skills. Use proper language structure and follow all the guidelines related to formatting and referencing. Never copy paste anything as plagiarized work always produces negative outcomes. Once you have completed your writing, do a final check on it before submission. In this, you need to check your spelling, grammar, formatting, and bibliography. Lastly, ensure that you have followed all the guidelines and instructions properly.**

## 5.Get external help

**Getting coursework help from professional coursework writing services is always helpful and beneficial. This comes out as the best solution particularly when you have less time. Constantly struggling with your coursework takes you nowhere but leaves you agitated. Its better you take coursework help from trusted companies who provide you complete support in you coursework writing. They have experienced and proficient writers who are experts in their fields of study. They can help you in preparing your coursework and submit it to you before your deadlines. Good grades are important for your coursework but so is your sanity.**

**Lastly, keep your spirits up and never lose motivation. Use these tips and set yourself up for success.**",2019-04-24 08:19:18

>Earlier this month, the WVU Board of Governors approved modest tuition and fee increases for WVU students starting next year. The headline-grabbing angle was that the hikes were the smallest in at least 20 years.

>The less well noticed nugget out of that BOG meeting was about spending cuts.  “The Board plans to reduce salaries, benefits and supplies by $14.8 million,” MetroNews’ Jeff Jenkins reported.

>Yesterday details of that planned reduction became clearer when WVU announced a Voluntary Separation Incentive Program (VSIP). That’s a fancy name for employee buyouts.

>Under the program, WVU may offer one-time lump sum payments to “eligible faculty and staff, who in return would agree to separate from employment with the University either by resignation or retirement.”

>The buyouts are open to all faculty and staff who meet the eligibility requirements, which include holding a regular, benefits-eligible position at the University and having 20 or more years of service. WVU Vice President for Strategic Initiatives Rob Alsop said that about 1,300 employees qualify for the buyout and the University estimates up to 130 will take it.

This seems to be the thing schools are doing now when they're in a financial crisis we're having financial problems. It lowers the amount of teachers that are in the University. It's also led to a few strikes when there isn't enough teachers that opt into the buyout.",2019-04-23 17:02:22

Prototype Holistic Mathematics Book,bg9mbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/bg9mbl/prototype_holistic_mathematics_book/,1,1555979130.0,0," 

Hey , 

&#x200B;

I'm a recent Chemical Engineering grad, and I've produced a prototype learning material for Mathematics which is complete with images and story-lines relating to each topic's real world applications, engaging scenario questions, a comprehensive list of proofs, thorough yet accessible concept breakdowns, inspiration sections and more. Although aimed at maths students at ages 16-18 (with topics at that level) , the book is perfect for college students and graduate taking or having completed STEM subjects, looking to learn Math in a new light. Hell, I was shocked at how much I learned writing the book at age 23, despite having gotten 92% in High School Math when I was 18, i.e the top grade (U.K A - Level grade A\*). 

&#x200B;

It's by no means any secret that Engineering courses are hard, but I think what makes them hard is that full understanding of topics both mathematically and conceptually isn't there. Having started with Maths, I plan to kick-start a line of Engineering books sometime this year. 

&#x200B;

The inspiration behind producing it, was me not being able to help but feel that Mathematics should instil a sense of wonder and discovery in students, and not feel like a chore. I'm hoping to spread the word so education in such a style can catch fire and blow up (i.e spread across the world and start a movement). 

&#x200B;

The book is free for the first 100 subscribers , I'm currently at 86. I won't charge much afterwards. 

&#x200B;

If you like it, help me out by spreading the word via Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Insta, Whatsapp or any other means, so I can get content out faster!

This year, in contrast to the 2018 “red state” teacher revolt, strikes in Los Angeles and Oakland confronted Democratic Party bosses and rulers at every level. The strikes were militant and massive, with broad working-class community support. But the union bureaucracies, chained to the Democrats, rammed through settlements that betrayed the struggle to stop the spread of charter schools, the drive to privatize and sharply reduce class size. Class Struggle Education Workers campaigned to mobilize workers’ power – shut down the ports! – to win the strikes. In New York, an ongoing fight against adjunct poverty at CUNY poses broader issues of linking the fight to defend public education to class struggle in the center of finance capital. The key: ousting the pro-capitalist bureaucrats, breaking with the Democrats and forging a class struggle leadership.

Why do some parents prioritize class-size at the expense of everything else?,bfn6qt,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/bfn6qt/why_do_some_parents_prioritize_classsize_at_the/,0,1555839521.0,9,"Let me preface this by saying I’m a product of private schools. I’m an advocate of private schools when done right....


Anyways, the theory goes: “if your student has a teacher with less kids in a class, they will learn better.” That line has become a marketing tactic. Small, for-profit private schools will advertise “small class sizes at a price that will not bankrupt you.” That’s all well and good in a perfect world, but what I keep telling parents is that the money doesn’t work on that fantasy. 


In my experience, any boutique school that has value will cost you big time. That’s because the cost of individualized treatment is very high. I I keep trying to explain when you sacrifice price in individualized treatment, you sacrifice quality. 

It is the high price that affords schools the luxury of small class-sizes mixed with nice facilities and a strong faculty. If you take out the “high priced” aspect of it, and you don’t replace that money from somewhere (like with charter schools), the economics don’t work. 

Schools that have a low-tuition and low class size, how will they afford to acquire what they need for a quality education? Teachers already make very little. No quality teacher is going to take what they can pay. Books and computers are expensive. Then there’s all the costs no one thinks about: school lunches, extra curricular activities, field trips, etc. How are they going to pay for that? The sad reality is they can’t, and they will make all sorts of promises while they cash their checks. 

I guess this is more of a rant than a question. I am mad that these type of schools exist. It’s definitely a “market” which is what I am worried about. That means there is a problem with the system and/or the perception of class sizes. 

Either way, it’s not really my problem. I work at a nice school. I just find this misperception about education to be baffling. A good teacher in a good school can teach 300 students better then a bad teacher can teach 3 students at a bad school.

Class Struggle Education Workers has repeatedly emphasized that “The public schools are where race and class intersect in the U.S., a country built on a bedrock of capitalist slavery. That is why the fight for free quality education for all has been a fundamental issue since the fight for abolition.” And ever since the 2014 study by the UCLA Civil Rights Project, issued on the 60th anniversary of the landmark *Brown v. Board of Education* court decision ordering school integration, it has been notorious, as we headlined in the *CSEW Newsletter* (No. 4, Fall 2014), that “New York Schools Have Worst Segregation in the U.S.”   
   
In recent weeks this vital issue has flared up again as figures were released in March showing that the numbers of African American and Hispanic students in these elite schools is tiny – less than 10%, even though they make up nearly 70% of public school students. At Stuyvesant High School, less than 1% of students are black (compared to 10% in 1971). And despite Mayor Bill de Blasio’s vow to diversify the specialized high schools, the numbers are falling. At Stuyvesant, out of 895 slots in the incoming freshman class, only 7 were offered to black students, down from 10 last year and 13 the year before. *This is nothing less than institutionalized racism.*

It's no secret that staff layoffs lead to huge class sizes. It's no secret that budget cuts lead to staff layoffs. Yet somehow, teachers are expected to manage with less and less, squeezed professionally as more responsiblities are heaped on, resources taken away, and personal financial shortfalls keep piling up. Of course throwing more money at a problem won't fix it, we're told so often, yet it seems like when *taking away* the money can be directly traced to causing the problem, it's odd to try and act like it's got nothing to do with it.

TLDR at bottom.

I apologize if there are better places to post this. I tried posting a few other places but didn't get any response, though someone told me to try here. 

Basically, i am looking to attend a masters program in either architecture or fashion design. To keep this somewhat concise, i'll avoid explaining why I am interested in these fields. I graduated (debt free) from college in spring 2018 with a bachelors in liberal studies, and a GPA of 2.72 as well as a less than impressive transcript to boot. To be honest, I was very lost in college, dealt with pretty severe depression, and wasn't excited to do or study anything. I only graduated by kind of floating through a multitude of menial classes.

After working odd jobs for the last year and doing a lot of reflecting, I finally feel as though I have lifted myself out of the depression and am ready to point my life in a new direction. I am interested in pursuing a masters degree in one of these two fields I have interest in (architecture/fashion design). Unfortunately, both fields require portfolios, which i do not have (despite taking art classes in college/high school- lost everything to a broken laptop and frequent moves). I am considering attending a community college to familiarize myself with programs and techniques used in one of these fields as well as create a portfolio, and then applying to a masters program. I am also considering trying to learn the important programs and techniques on my own, and then craft my portfolio from home.

So I need advice on: what the benefits are for architecture/ fashion design as a career, what steps I should take to develop a portfolio/ what could be beneficial to include in my portfolio, what steps I can take to make up for my poor GPA and transcript, what steps I can take to look in to an affordable loan/ an affordable university to attend a masters program, and what steps I can take to be more financially secure throughout this process. I am also curious as to whether it would be wise to obtain my associates in one of the fields and then apply to graduate school, or if that would be a waste of my time and money (as a result of being forced to take unnecessary classes).

I want to include that though I am not in a rush to make this happen for myself, I would hope to be able to finish a masters program before I am 30. If what I'm hoping for is unrealistic, please let me know that too.

Thanks everyone!

In the last months, our team of 3 has secured a small but crucial funding that will cover the first 4-week trip to Ghana, where we will do field research. We have been developing strategy and promotional materials and started establishing links with potential partners in Ghana.

But there is a limit to how much 3 people can do. We are now looking for participants to co-create this project in a peer-driven network. For this reason, we created r/Collaborate4nature. (If you go there, please check the brochure first)

Part of the project presents incentivizing local people for collecting plastic waste. Another part - even more important in the long run - is educating communities about the importance of clean environment and waste management.

* You are concerned about the environment
* You already have a strong idea of how sustainability and ecology should be taught // or you would like to participate in creating and implementing an educational plan
* The thought of being part of a project from the very beginning doesn't scare you but rather tickles your imagination
* You see problems as obstacles, rather than walls. And you understand that change is possible.

Her teaching style was so good that I learned without trying. When I went to college, I completely changed. I went from getting C's and D's to getting straight A's with the occasional B.  In college I took a couple of liberal arts math courses and got A's in them.

However, I found my true potential in math when I took upper-level courses in chemistry. It involved A LOT of math, but I completely understood it! I paid attention, studied, and really cared about it. I was so amazed that I was able to memorize and combine complicated formulas. I remember it got to the point where I had to solve one equation, just to plug the answer into another equation, and then another and another. I was amazed at myself. I was so estatic going to chemistry because I actually understood the math. I loved the chemistry too, but the math gave me so much joy. It gave me so much confidence that I understood the formulas and didn't just memorize them. It made me love math.

Junior and senior years were progressively harder. I took trigonometry/algebra 2 in Junior, where I find it confusing and difficult. I got a 65 on the final, barely passing.

Sorry if this is the wrong sub for this!

The title says most of it. I achieved really mediocre A-levels and got into university through the skin of my teeth, basically though interviewing very well. (My interviews showed I knew what I needed to know, even if my exam results didn't). Completed my psych degree and came out with a 2:1 (2% away from a first argggg) and paper going in for publishing by the university on my thesis.

I transitioned into a digital job in UI/UX design, which actually focused alot on psychology principals, but the job I had for the last 2 years just folded and I'm sat re-evaluating my career. I enjoyed it but always felt it was missing something.

I was actually on track to go into biomedical sciences and then into medicine after my a levels, but due to a very poor decision I changed course to move university to be with my girlfriend at the time. My teachers at school thought I'd be a good candidate for medicine, attentive, switched on and great 'bedside manner'(customer service basically). And they supported me into the 'long route' to medidne, which was biomed -> medicine post grad.

Now I'm here with below average A-levels for medicine (traditionally want at least AAB or 120+ UCAS points, I don't have that!) and my chem and bio knowledge atrophied from the years not studying it. But I'm sure I could pick it back up with some hard work.

Should I retake my a levels and then do one of the 'convert' courses into medicine (where they take a university grade in a science - yes psych is applicable - as part of the entry requirements). Or is it too late for my ass? And I should commit to UI/UX?

On the topic of education there is a timestamp above where they discuss this for about 60 seconds. I personally think this is more feasible than the present system. Sounds logical, right?

The thing is, I was lucky enough to not have to worry about paying tuition and dorms at 50,000 USD / year. My family still felt the financial burden, but of course, I think this is a more logical system. 

EDIT: I personally think that **pledging** 5% of your earnings to the university you graduate until all bills are paid + guaranteeing a *little* profit to the school (say 3% of your total expenses) is much more ~~viable~~ reasonable. Graduating from university doesn't guarantee significantly higher income. It does, however, in many cases break down a wall to obtaining employment. The only reason I graduated is because I wanted to work in a foreign country, and in the country where I reside getting an employment visa without being married to a local or having an undergraduate degree is close to impossible unless you are really really wealthy.",2019-04-15 20:26:48

How should I study for lesson planning?,bdkoyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/bdkoyx/how_should_i_study_for_lesson_planning/,15,1555358425.0,14,"I'm not really in a teaching position yet, I'm still in my B.A. actually but I figured that since the way I study probably influences how my lessons will be, I decided to drop in here and ask you about it.

I'm a huge notetaker; when I study a book I write all the questions it makes me ask and then write the answer if the book was too unclear or leave the page number if the book explained things well. I did this with approximately 6 books of a certain discipline and now have all information I need to teach it. 

This approach to studies, however, brought me a problem. When I got to analize my notes I realized that they were a mess. Not that they were incorrect, it's just that they looked more like random facts than a progressive story, which was further proved when I had difficulty explaining the content in an orderly way. 

This made me think that I couldn't teach well in my future high school class and so to counteract this challenge I considered typing all the info I wrote in just one .Word file, in the orderly way I wanted. In my head it made me understand better but it seems it would take a lot of time to do it and I wonder if it's worth it, after all I'd need to make a simpler version anyways for the kids.

What do you think? Should I use Word to heighten my understanding or is studying each book separately without rewriting them enough? Is there anything else regarding my method (for studies or lesson planning) that you believe could be improved?",2019-04-15 15:00:25

 It feels as though my learning ability has  been on a steady decline and I dont know what to do. 

I'm running a D average in college calc and a C- in chemistry. Of course I also had microbio but I dropped that as I got too stressed out. It's near the end of the semester, finals are in a few weeks and I dont know what to do to fix my grades, no less my GPA. 

 It always rips me apart when I can never get a second chance at a test without retaking the entire college course. If I get an A or B on a final, that goes to show that I learned my material, but it doesnt matter because a few of my tests were bad.

But today colleges are so expensive that the typical student must take out commercial loans offered by for-profit banking institutions -- loans that cannot be discharged by the student, a life-long burden of [debt peonage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_bondage).

Noam Chomsky noted the new dynamic saying:

> Students who acquire large debts putting themselves through school are unlikely to think about changing society. When you trap people in a system of debt they can't afford the time to think. Tuition fee increases are a disciplinary technique, and by the time students graduate, they are not only laded with debt, but have also internalized the disciplinarian culture. This makes them efficient components of the consumer economy.

[Statistics say](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112432364) that the debt and for-profit interest payments accumulated by college students will pay off long down the road by a higher income by the college student. This turns the goal of college from being one of seeking knowledge to a goal of ""job training"" and seeking a high income to pay off debts and thus escape [debt peonage](https://www.antislavery.org/).

What is worse is that [nearly half of millennials say college wasn't worth the student-loan debt](https://www.thisisinsider.com/millennials-college-not-worth-student-loan-debt-2019-4).

Read that again: *Nearly 1/2!*

At a time when it *is common* for other advanced countries in Europe to offer *free college* we in the US have created a for-profit system in which *nearly 1/2* of the participants going to college say it is not worth it -- statistics be damned.

I have followed very strictly what my sons teachers have suggested for reading at each grade level, and encourage or make him read each day.  He hates it, and has struggled finding something that makes this fee less like work and more like entertainment.

Recently he shared that a new reading plan was starting at school and he made the comment that he will read at my house and then gets a week off when he goes to his moms.  He shared that she doesn’t make him read which blew my mind.  I decided I should at least call his mom to explain this new program and that he is expected to read 30 minutes a day.  

When I spoke to her and shared how we do reading and the upcoming expectations she made a comment that she doesn’t really make him read.  She shared that she feels he has developed what his reading skill will be, she wasn’t sure why she felt that way, but felt it is what it is.

While he gets the rules and game, he can and will still develop and get better but only if he practices.  She didn’t really agree.

I dismissed it out of hand, ludicrous, completely unfounded in reality. I ran across it again a few years into teaching and was absolutely floored by how accurate it was. 

This brings out some of those same feelings, along with frustration that this is what the system pushes us into doing.

>We are teaching students, literally, not to think, but instead to clear their own thoughts and concentrate on following the path followed by the people who wrote the test questions. We are teaching them that every question has just one right answer, that somebody out there already knows it, and that you go to school to learn to say what those people want you to say.  This is not a new issue in education, but we have ramped it up, systematically injected it into every level of K-12 education, and incentivized it like never before.

It's largely a conceptual course (very little math) that aims to explain the fundamental principles of chemistry and relate them back to everyday applications.  Two of my goals with this course are (1) to stir up an interest in science among those who might think it isn't for them and (2) to increase scientific literacy so students are able to analyze basic claims to determine if they're legit or not.  It's been a lot of fun to teach, especially as I'm used to classes full of STEM majors but now I'm lecturing to students majoring in art, theater, business, nutrition, graphic design, law, etc.  Their excitement and wonder is contagious!

One thing I'd like to add to the course is a short video (3-5 minutes) every week that highlights a chemist (or scientist) working in various fields talking about their background and what they do.  For example, one week is a chemist working in cosmetics, next week is forensics, then agriculture, then pharmaceuticals, etc.  I'd especially like to feature stories of scientists from underrepresented groups (women, Hispanics, Blacks, etc.) so students see that science, and chemistry in particular, is open to anyone.

The only website I've found along these lines is [Behind the Scenes at MIT](http://chemvideos.mit.edu/all-videos/).  Can you recommend another?  (If not, I think I might just launch my own and begin interviewing various scientist friends.)

Im gonna take the AP Gov test soon

Common Core has lost their minds.,b9jao9,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/b9jao9/common_core_has_lost_their_minds/,8,1554416810.0,22,"Today was the 2nd day of Ela testing for my kids. The test has been brutal. The length of time is bordering on cruel and unusual punishment. The top students (who didn't opt out) told me how difficult it was. These students find all the coursework easy during the year unless they are challenged with enrichment activities.

Let's now take the middle of the road student. 3-6 hours for this test? 5 stories each with short answer questions? Then an essay with 4 required parts?  THE CHILDREN ARE 10 AND 11 YEARS OLD!!!

Now to my IEP (special needs) students. These students are typically reading 2 to 3 years below grade level. To watch them use the strategies taught and still suffer is mind blowing.

I'm all for testing. We need data... I get it. But let's make this a fair assessment and appropriate for the age level it's given to. Ridiculous. ",2019-04-04 17:26:50
Smart like a Fox: How clever students trick dump programming assessment systems,b9nbob,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/b9nbob/smart_like_a_fox_how_clever_students_trick_dump/,2,1554442554.0,0,"This case study reports on two first-semester programming courses with more than 190 students. Both courses made use of automated assessments. We observed how students trick these systems by analysing the version history of suspect submissions. By analysing more than 3300 submissions, we revealed four astonishingly simple tricks (overfitting, evasion) and cheat-patterns (redirection, and injection) that students used to trick automated programming assignment assessment systems (APAAS). Although not the main focus of this study, it discusses and proposes corresponding counter-measures where appropriate.   
Nevertheless, the primary intent is to raise problem awareness and to identify and systematise observable problem patterns in a more formal approach. The identified immaturity of existing APAAS solutions might have implications for courses that rely deeply on automation like MOOCs. Therefore, we conclude to look at APAAS solutions much more from a security point of view (code injection). Moreover, we identify the need to evolve existing unit testing frameworks into more evaluation-oriented teaching solutions that provide better trick and cheat detection capabilities and differentiated grading support.

Banning phones from schools; is it the best idea?,b93t2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/b93t2a/banning_phones_from_schools_is_it_the_best_idea/,89,1554325983.0,167,"Effective from September 2019 Ontario will ban phones in classrooms. Is this really the best solution?   
I believe teachers using the phones and technology to their advantage in classroom is a better idea than prohibiting students from taking their cellphones with them to class. Its 2019 and it just seems that we are moving backwards. I understand that it can be a major distraction to students but it can also benefit them if used correctly. I remember when teachers didn't want anyone to speak a word in class but now group discussions are proven to make students engage more. We are living in the age of thechnology however our education is nowhere near that. Educational content can become much more relatable for students and I can guaranty that more students will become interested in learning and you will see many better marks and less people skipping classes. Take a look at this blog post that goes further into details:
